1. At first, we display Bootstrap's file input field so that the user can select a file.
2. Then, we display a text field where the user can enter the owner's details.
3. Then, we have two buttons. The first one is to store the file hash and the owner's
details in the contract, and the second button is to get information on the file from
the contract. Clicking on the Submit button triggers the submit() method,
whereas clicking on the Get Info button triggers the getInfo() method.
4. Then, we have an alert box to display messages.
5. Finally, we display an ordered list to display the transactions of the contract that
gets mined while the user is on the page.
